# 1.30.1.0
This release brings a fix to an issue that was included in the previous release. It affected the LuUpdate application and the problem was that the application could transfer an excessive amount of data in specific scenarios, mainsly when errors occured with the update. We also added more logs to more easily debug these issues in the future and also improved the analytics a little bit.
