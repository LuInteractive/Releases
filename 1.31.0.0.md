# 1.31.0.0
This release brings the new September application

## New application
* The application **Shapes** launched! Enter the Shäpes arena and practice matching solids to their net. Defend your goal against the opponent's offense and score points by sending the right solids into the other team's goal.
* Added quality of life improvements to Groove. Note that choreographies now need to be selected from the first move to the last. You can no longer start a selection elsewhere in the choreography.
* It was possible for save games from Groove dans Tactik to show up in LuCommunity. This update fixes this problem.
* A purple cloud will now be shown in the top right corner of the icon of applications in the OS that are not exclusive to CMS, but are available in the CMS. At this point in time, these applications are Newton and Puzz. This purple cloud used to be shown only for applications that are exclusive to the CMS.
